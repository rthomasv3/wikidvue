# wikidvue

WikidVue is a work in progress note taking app with markdown support. The goal of the project is to create a simple and clean app you can host yourself with a mobile first design and PWA. The app will also be available on desktop via electron and work with local `.md` files. A self-hostable sync server is also under development.

The prototype is being created in Vue 3 and a client-side only preview is available at [https://demo.wikidvue.xyz/](https://demo.wikidvue.xyz/).
